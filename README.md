# Eugen

Eugen is the successor to the sadly abandoned [Kilian](https://github.com/rechen-werk/Kilian) Discord Bot. After facing some issues with the old codebase, we decided to start from scratch and build a new bot in a more suited and modern language that is based on the JVM. Eugen is written in Kotlin instead of Python and should provide the same features and fix some issues that were present in Kilian.
